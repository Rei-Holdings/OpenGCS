# OpenGCS
Open Source Drone GCS software tailored to flexibility. Compatible with Arduino and NRF24 modules.

## Introduction
The OpenGCS is a Rei Technologies product. OpenGCS is being developed in an open source manner so more people can enjoy the benefits of the software. OpenGCS is intended to be used with an Arduino (any type but specifically designed for Leonardo) and an NRF24 module contacting a 2.4GHz RX or RX/TX on a drone.

## Roadmap
OpenGCS is planning for several things in the future:
1. First Beta Release
2. First Full Release
3. Expansion to other RX/TX modules
4. Expansion+Optimizations for specific Arduino boards
5. RTL, Loiter, Follow Me, and other improvements

## Framework
OpenGCS is made from a mix of Python-based Processing for UI, Arduino sketches for basic code, and C/C++ for libraries and other residuals.
